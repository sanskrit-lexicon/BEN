## verbs01
April 2020.  Identify Benfey entries which are roots and correspond with MW spellings. 
 Further identify the prefixes (upasargas) within roots and
correspond them to MW where possible.

See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/BEN/issues/1 for introduction.

## eng_error_lang
Benfey contains many Latin words.  In identifying possible *English* spelling errors, it is useful to discard words that are in a Latin wordlist.
This directory contains a Latin word list derived from http://archives.nd.edu/whitaker/dictpage.htm.
Also word lists for other languages (A.S.,  O.H.G., Goth., and a few others) were prepared. See the directory's readme.txt for some review of what was done.
