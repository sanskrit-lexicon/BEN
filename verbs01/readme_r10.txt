There is an error in the AS-IAST conversion that needs correcting.
The errors:  
'ṛ10' should be 'ṝ' (220 instances)
'Ṛ10' should be 'Ṝ' (32 instances)


In a few cases, the SLP1 spellings are also in error:
L=3755, kf -> kF  (scatter)
L=3756, kf -> kF  (kill)
L=3757, kf -> kF  (know)
L=3758, kft -> kFt (= mw kIrt: to celebrate)
L=9172, pf -> pF (fill)
L=16356, sf -> sF  (see svF)

Other changes:
L=6043, {%tṝ,%} -> {%TṜ,%}  (this is verb. so should be upper case. print change
L=9170, {%pṝṣṭhānuga,%} -> {%pṛṣṭhānuga,%} SHORT vocalic r.  print change
