THEODORE BENFEY 

[PageII+ 30]
<H>PREFACE.
<NI>FOR some years past there has been no Sanskrit Dictionary available
for the English student. The second edition of that by Wilson,
published in 1831, has been long exhausted, as also Yates’ Abridg-
ment, published in Calcutta in 1846. Dr. Goldstücker's excellent
work has not yet reached the end of the first vowel, and the St.
Petersburg Dictionary, by Messrs. Böhtlingk and Roth, besides being
in German, has only just completed the letter {%ph.%}
<P>The present work aims at supplying this long-felt want. It does
not exceed the limits of one volume, but at the same time it is hoped
that it contains all that the student is likely to require. It especially
includes all the words occurring in the different Chrestomathies and
Selections generally in use (as Lassen's Anthology, my own Chre-
stomathy, Bopp's Nala, Johnson's Mahābhārata Selections, &c.),
and in the texts usually read by students, as the Hitopadeśa, Pañca-
tantra, Manu's Laws, Śakuntalā, Vikramorvaśī, Uttararāmacarita,
Mālatīmādhava, and Meghadūta; but it is also believed to contain
most of the words likely to occur in the general classical literature.
It does not profess to contain the technical terms of the grammarians
or philosophers, nor are purely Vaidik words included, except such
as occur in the extracts given in the above-mentioned Chresto-
mathies.
<P>References have been added to the greater part of the meanings,
and sometimes explanations of passages also; but these latter are
rarely introduced, for fear of swelling the volume beyond its proper
size. For the same reason, compound words are generally printed
in roman type, and arranged alphabctically under their last part.
Thus the student must look for {%a-maṅgala, au-aṃśa,%} and {%megha-dūta%}
respectively under {%maṅgala, aṃśa,%} and {%dūta.%} The difficulty arising
from this source will soon disappear with practice. If a word. as for 

[PageIII+ 33]
instance {%candraśekhara,%} is not found under {%c,%} its first component
part {%candra%} will be found; and the student has only to turn to the
letter {%ś%} to find the remaining part {%śekhara,%} and under it in its place
the very word he is in search of.
<P>For the same reason, feminies ending in {%ā, ī, ū, ikā,%} are inserted
under the corresponding masculines (where there are such) in {%a, i,%}
{%ṛ, n, nt, añc, as, u, aka;%} while participles, participles used as sub-
stantives, and absolutives are inserted under the verbs to which they
belong.
<P>The etymology of every word is given, where ascertainable; but
here also, to save space, abbreviations have been used. The several
parts of a compound word are separated by hyphens, except in the
case of the grammatical element, which is always preceded by + :
thus, in p. 2, {%a-karuṇa + tva%} denotes that this word is compounded
of {%a%} and {%karuṇa,%} with the affix {%tva;%} and similarly, in p. 397, {%dāśa-%}
{%rathi%} is analysed as {%daśaratha + i.%}
<P>As Sanskrit is also of the greatest use in the study of Comparative
Grammar, I have added at the end of the principal articles the
kindred words in the Greek, Latin, and German (particularly the
Gothic and Anglo-Saxon) languages.
<P>I have availed myself of the valuable labours of my predecessors,
especially the works, already mentioned, of Wilson, Goldstücker,
Böhtlingk, and Roth (as far as published), besides the Śabdakal-
padruma of Rāja Rādhākānta Deva, and the various glossaries which
have been published for special books; but for the latter half some
of there aids have failed me, and I have been chiefly left to my own
resources. I must therefore crave the reader's indulgence for the
deficiencies and shortcomings which he may discover.
<P>I cannot close this Preface without expressing my sincere thanks
to Mr. E. B. Cowell and Professor Max Müller, for the assistance
which they have rendered to me while carrying this work through
the press.
